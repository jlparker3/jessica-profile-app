<p>Hi there, my name is Jessica Parker! I am 25 years old. I live in Chicago, IL. I have two cats named Luna and Milo. Both my partner, Holly, and I both work in healthcare. I would like to use my knowledge that I gain throughout my time at this bootcamp to change careers to be more flexible to my ideal lifestyle.</p>
